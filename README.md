Name of Subject In charge: Miss Pooja M. Bharti
Subject Name: OOP-I Subject Code: 3140705
Academic Year: 2021-22 Semester: 4th Sr.
No. Name of Question
1 What are command line arguments? Write a java program which reads a line from command line and prints that line in reverse? [3]
2
Write a method for computing XY doing repetitive multiplication. X and y are of type integer and are to be given as command line arguments. Raise and handle exception(s) for invalid values of X and y. [7]
3 Write a program to check whether the name given from command line is file or not? If it is a file then print the size of a file and if it is a directory then it should display the name of all files in it. [7] 4
Write an abstract class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. A student has enrollment, course. An employee has an office, salary, and designation. Define constructors and methods for input and display for both classes. Write a main program to give demonstration of all. [7]
5
Consider following code fragment: [4]
try {
statement1;
04
2
statement2;
statement3;
}
catch (Exception1 ex1) {
}
finally {
statement4;
}
statement5;
1. Which Statements will execute if no exception is occurs.
2. Which Statements will execute if Exception 1 is occurs at statement 2.
6 Write a program that counts number of characters, words, and lines in a text file. [7]
7 Write a program that reads file name from user, through command line argument and displays/reads content of the text file on console. [3]
8
Write a JAVA program to create a super class called figure that stores the dimensions of a twodimensional object. It also defines a method called area () that computes the area of an object. The program derives two sub classes from figure. The first is rectangle and the second is Triangle. Each of these subclasses overrides area (), so that it returns the area of a rectangle and a triangle respectively. [7]

9 Write a JAVA program to implement the Fibonacci series using for loop control structure. [7] 10
Describe abstract class called Shape, which has three subclasses say Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle. Define one method area() in the abstract class and override this area() in these three subclasses to calculate for specific object i.e. area() of Triangle subclass should calculate area of triangle likewise for Rectangle and Circle. [7]
11 Write a JAVA program to read student.txt file and display the content. [4]
12 Write a program that counts the number of words in a text file. The file name is passed as a command line argument. The words in the file are separated by white space characters. [7]
13
Write a program that illustrates interface inheritance. Interface P is extended by P1 and P2. Interface P12 inherits from both P1 and P2. Each interface declares one constant and one method. class Q implements P12. Instantiate Q and invoke each of its methods.
Each method displays one of the constants. [7]
14 Write a java program to implement the multiple inheritance concepts for calculating area of circle and square. [7]
15 Write a program to take string input as command line argument. In addition, count occurrence of each character in a given string. [7]
16
