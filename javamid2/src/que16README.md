No.	String	                                                     
1) The String class is immutable.	
2) String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance
3) String class overrides the equals() method of Object class. So you can compare the contents of two strings by equals() method.
4) String class is slower while performing concatenation operation
5) String class uses String constant pool.
